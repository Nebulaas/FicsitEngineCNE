IMPORTANT!!!

This is what a mods folder should look like for Codename Engine.
The question is, how do you actually get this mod to work?

For getting the mod to show up in-game, put the base mod folder into Codename Engine's mod folder; take nothing out of this folder as it won't work.

For specific elements, look in the other folders for more information.

(Don't expect everything to be documented as I haven't learned everything yet)
